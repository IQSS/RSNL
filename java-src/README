Some java classes that provide bridges between RSNL and the Stanford
NLP code.  The edu/ tree is a Frankenstein of the edu/ trees from the
Stanford POS tagger and the Stanford NER.

We built the hybrid tree by:
  Using NER code whenever
    the file only appeared in the NER tree
    the file appeared in both trees
  Using POS code whenever
    the file only appeared in the POS tree

We also had to make two small changes to
tagger/maxent/ExtractorFramesRare.java to make it work with the newer
NER code.  These changes are on lines 1194 and 1224 and are tagged
with DBP (+ orig code) comments in the source.
