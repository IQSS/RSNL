    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nassauer has undoubtedly produced a good report, to the extent that a decision has already been reached with the Council at first reading. I would like, however, to highlight certain aspects that give rise to further thought. We are debating the third directive without a clear insight into what have been the effects of the second directive. This excessive and erratic haste, which should have led us to assess money laundering also in terms of the fight against terrorism, has, in my opinion, led us to rush through the process, when further reflection was required. In particular, I believe that excessive attention has been paid to the matter of suspicion, when perhaps we should concentrate more on certainties, by ensuring individual guarantees. The second aspect, which, in my opinion, remains unresolved, concerns the thorny question of lawyers. On this matter, I believe that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs forcefully lays down some points for reflection that Parliament must consider further.
