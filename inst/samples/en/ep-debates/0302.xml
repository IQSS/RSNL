    Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to what the last speaker said. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of this programme. If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, if we want jobs for everyone, we must help people to achieve this goal. After all, people in employment are best placed to meet their own basic needs. That is why it is so important that all those disadvantaged groups know that Europe exists and that it can provide them with support in finding jobs, in gaining extra qualifications, in changing working conditions, and so on, and it is for that reason that I congratulate Mrs Jöns on this report. I should like to answer two questions. I have just received a note to which I can now respond in my own language. The first question is: how do you actually arrive at the amount mentioned in your amendment? The amount that was proposed at the time was EUR 854 million, which was still wishful thinking on the part of Mrs Jöns. We then thought that such an amount was not attainable, but we subsequently joined forces and arrived at a final sum of EUR 858 million in Mr Böge’s report. That is why we have increased the amount from EUR 854 million to 858 million, and I assume that everyone is agreed on this. We have also changed the percentages. We wanted to do the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality a favour by setting aside more funds for gender equality and we also wanted to put some money aside for working conditions. I think that those issues are worthwhile and that they can redress the balance in PROGRESS to some extent. Finally, it is because all those minor incidental programmes do not make life any easier that I am delighted with PROGRESS, which will enable us to channel our money, commitment and energy much more effectively. I would therefore support everyone involved in this PROGRESS programme, and I hope that those two amendments tabled by our group will make it past the finishing line.
