    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets gives a welcome to the Commission’s proposed programme for lifelong learning, which encompasses the four great programmes – Erasmus, Comenius, Leonardo and Grundtvig – and it is founded upon the fundamental conviction that the value of these programmes in terms of structural change in Europe is not to be underestimated and that they play an essential part in European renewal. In our opinion, we welcome the proposal’s intention to simplify administration and financial procedures, while criticising the fact that they are still too burdensome and too slow. We have to point out that the budget figures are provisional, but the Committee on Budgets does take the view that the amounts proposed by the Commission for this vitally important priority area cannot be regarded as other than very modest. Formal comment on what the Commission has proposed is one thing, but the vote, which is a political matter, will be far more to do with the need to move on in this area and achieve Europe’s vital educational policy goals.
