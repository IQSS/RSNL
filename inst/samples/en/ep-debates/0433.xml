    Mr President, talking is all very well, but action is better. Oil prices, combating pollution, road safety, working conditions for drivers, the deterioration of infrastructures due to lorries: these are all reasons why the development of rail freight must be treated as an absolute priority, but please allow me to be concerned and impatient because, where we should be acting firmly and quickly, at the moment the European Union is being weak and feeble! It must be noted that the trans-European rail infrastructure projects are progressing at a snail’s pace. Furthermore, I am alarmed by Mr Barrot’s participation, on 12 July, in a meeting of the lobby of road transport employers, within the context of a review of the White Paper on transport, neglecting rail in favour of roads. Mr Barrot should have stated that he would be more vigilant with regard to the need for rail investment. There is therefore only one question on the agenda: is there really the will to promote a determined policy of developing rail freight in Europe? That is the only question that matters.
