    Madam President, if I may come straight to the point, we are, today, saying a heartfelt ‘yes’ to a European approach for more efficient energy use, but I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe and the Commission on the proposal and the report on energy efficiency. The more efficient use of energy is in all our interests; we all stand to benefit from it. Greater efficiency means a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, which, in turn, helps us meet our Kyoto obligations. Consumers and governments save on their energy bills, and energy-efficient companies become more competitive. Innovation is the key word here and I unreservedly endorse the top runner principle in Amendment 96. Critics who view this proposal as needless interference from Brussels in their domestic affairs forget the unfortunate fact that, without external pressure, too little is done in order to make our energy consumption more efficient, but I think that Mr Piebalgs’ top down approach should be complemented by its opposite. Amendment 45 challenges enterprises to come up with all kinds of proposals on more efficient energy consumption. I wholeheartedly support the Commission in its endeavour to get Member State governments to lead by example. Governments are ideally placed to make investments in energy efficiency that are unprofitable in the short term but that are recovered in the longer term. Whether by purchasing clean and economical official cars, refuse lorries, electronic equipment or investing in energy-efficient buildings, governments are ideally placed to address this problem. In this context, I also think that we as European institutions have an additional responsibility. Not only should we impose obligations on the Member States, we must also accept the challenge to enhance our own energy efficiency. I suggest that the European Commission, Parliament and the Council all compete against each other to find out which is the most energy-efficient institution. The outcome could be presented to the public and press during next year’s Green Week, and, while I am on this subject, I should like to say that I think there is room for an improvement of over 30% in the new Parliament building.
