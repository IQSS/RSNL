    Madam President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, who has had a tremendous job of work to do. Recent research carried out by ‘Which?’, the UK consumer association, has shown that 98 per cent of people that it spoke to want health and nutrition claims on food to be authorised so that they can be certain that the food they buy is indeed the product described on the packaging with the qualities that are attributed to that product. In my Group we agree that there is a need for authorisation, not notification, because self – regulation does not work. We need an authorisation procedure and, as others have said, we need to maintain the nutrient profiles – Article 4 – not least to protect children from being the targets of misleading advertising. Sixteen per cent of children in the UK between the ages of two and fifteen are obese, and the problem is getting worse. This demands a very strong response. We cannot allow foods that are high in salt or sugar to be marketed as being good for children’s health. Finally, we have to ensure better and clearer information for the public so that this important new legislation is as effective as possible.
