    Mr President, illegal and harmful content on the Internet is of real concern not only to this Parliament but also to people outside Parliament. Child pornography, and also racist and violent material, is a real problem for our society. Although parents are not always aware, we have also noticed that many of our children make contact with people in chat rooms and then they like to have contact outside chat rooms. Therefore there is real danger. That is why we want this safer Internet programme which has played a key role in the Commission's action to protect minors in the field of audiovisual and information services. Firstly – and I am going to be very brief, Mr President, because you asked me to – there are the networks of hotlines where users can report illegal content; there are 18 Member States participating. Then there is the network for raising awareness of safer use of the Internet, with 21 countries participating in network awareness nodes. Then there is content rating and the parental control technologies, where we are setting up an international system for rating Internet content and improving filtering technology. The first action plan involved 37 projects bringing together 136 organisations from 70 countries. The new programme is of course going to be in continuity, but also enhancing what we have done so far. It is very simple, there are new technologies, so there are new forms of usage by those who threaten children. Therefore we have to find new answers and that is exactly what we are trying to do, working very closely with the safer Internet forum. To make a long story short – and it is story that interests parents and society at large – Parliament and the Commission are working on the same lines. All the amendments today are acceptable, which is good news for Parliament, so there will be no clashes here and we can agree on a general line. That is the way also that I am going to listen to Parliament’s proposals.
