    Mr President, children must have safe medicines, adapted to their needs. That is an obvious requirement of legislation. With a patent extension as long as six months, we are, however, paying an unnecessarily high price for having the pharmaceutical companies fulfil obvious requirements. The pharmaceutical companies already have multiannual protection and EUR 100 billion in their coffers for purchases. They can tolerate a 1% increase in costs much better than already depleted public budgets. We must not transfer even more money to these companies. In doing so, we should finally end up with safe medicines for both children and adults, but with no one able to afford them. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have put forward a compromise amendment involving a maximum of four months, with the further limitations described by Mrs Breyer. If this is unacceptable, Parliament will show that it is more attentive to the pharmaceutical companies’ lobbyists than to the needs of children.
