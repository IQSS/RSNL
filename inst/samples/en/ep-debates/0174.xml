    Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by saying that the proposal the Commission has presented to us is a good and balanced proposal and that the rapporteur has done good work; I therefore congratulate her. Research has shown that the consumption of fortified foodstuffs within a varied diet can contribute significantly to the ingestion of nutrients. The important thing is that fortification be based on scientific criteria and that the agri – food industries operating in the European Union be subject to common rules, and that is precisely the objective of this proposal: the harmonisation of the differing national provisions on fortifications, within the limits required in order to guarantee food safety, of course. We in the PPE-DE, therefore, cannot agree with the inclusion of provisions allowing for the existence of stricter rules in the States, unless they can be justified on the grounds of a proven risk to public health. Neither do we in my group agree with the introduction of nutrient profiles, and, in fact, the Commission has not introduced them into the proposal. They are neither necessary nor appropriate in this proposal. We enjoy a very varied food supply in the European Union and we cannot imagine that we can put an end to obesity and persuade the Europeans to eat properly by means of standards and labelling. The solution is much more complex. Foodstuffs must be healthy, of course, and the consumer must be provided with reliable information, but the really important thing is the diet that each person chooses and the lifestyle they live. Consumer education, therefore, is more effective than rules, so that consumers can exercise their freedom of choice on the basis of reliable criteria. With regard to the other substances in Annex 3, I must say that their potential restriction must be based solely on safety criteria and we do not, therefore, support the amendments aimed at introducing positive lists to regulate these substances. Finally, I believe that manufacturers, particularly small and medium – sized businesses, must be given sufficient time to adapt to the new provisions laid down in the Regulation.
