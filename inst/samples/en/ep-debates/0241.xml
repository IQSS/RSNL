    Mr President, safeguarding the security of the electricity supply and ensuring an adequate level of interconnection between the infrastructures of the Member States is absolutely essential, particularly at a time when we are planning to set up and enhance the single market for energy. In this context, I felt, when it came to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing up its draft opinion on this report, that the Commission and Parliament should offer us a global perspective on this issue. It is clear that a sound single market for energy cannot be created in an environment in which there is major inequality in the conditions of supply, in terms of price, regularity and indeed taxation. This crucial market will also be incapable of growing stronger unless there is a shared vision of the use of the various forms of energy production. The issue of safety – of the energy supply and the interconnection of infrastructures – must not merely be as a consequence of, and in response to, the sudden shutdowns that have happened in recent times and that have had a highly detrimental effect on the development of the European economy. These elements must be – and I wish to stress this point – the building blocks of the common energy policy and must be the catalyst for the much-needed policy of increasing energy efficiency and of diversifying sources of energy. Unfortunately, some of the proposals that I tabled in my committee did not receive the required majority, despite the fact that they are based directly on the philosophy that I have just detailed, a philosophy that, I am sure, is shared by most Members of this House. Stepping up investment in the distribution network and in the interconnection of networks will help to improve the competitiveness of the Member States’ economies and to drive forward the European economy. It will also make it possible to strike the necessary balance between supply and demand, within a framework of excessive differentiation. Mr Chichester’s report takes these points on board and, accordingly, represents a positive step towards improving upon the Commission’s proposal. Nonetheless, the report needs to be adopted so that the codecision process can be closed at first reading. The main priority, however, is that the European institutions must be seen to be capable of reforming the energy market from a European policy perspective, taking a global view of every aspect.
