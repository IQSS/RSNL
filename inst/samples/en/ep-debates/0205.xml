    Mr President, first I should like to thank the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, for their work on this subject at first reading. If we are to shape a good environmental policy, then we need to have good information. The directive being debated, therefore, will help considerably in improving this basic information infrastructure. Indeed, the shaping of policy is frequently hampered by the fact that information is often not available in a form which enables it to be used. Often the data simply do not exist or they exist but are inadequately substantiated or of unsatisfactory quality. At other times, the information is fragmentary and comes in a variety of different forms and types, making it impossible to use it in order to shape policy at European level. In other cases, the information is in the hands of government agencies which do not wish to publish it. European policy-makers either come up against refusal to allow them to access the relevant information or are forced to accept onerous and costly licensing arrangements in order to obtain access to the data. As a result, our environmental policy is not based on knowledge to the maximum possible and desired extent. INSPIRE will help to remove these barriers by forcing government agencies to improve documentation and ensure that their data systems are interoperable. Similarly, they will share data with each other and with the public. In this way, the infrastructure of knowledge will be improved not only for environmental policy, but also in other policy areas which use the same geographical data. Over the last six months, intensive discussions have been held between the three institutions in a bid to achieve agreement at the first reading of this subject. Unfortunately, however, this proved impossible, due to continuing concerns being put forward by certain Member States in connection with intellectual property rights. Nonetheless, I am particularly grateful for the persistence and attention with which Parliament, in other words the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, managed to reach an agreement with the Council. During these discussions, Parliament proved that it clearly understands the importance of removing the barriers to which I referred earlier, in order to improve the knowledge infrastructure for environmental policy.
