    Mr President, it is beyond dispute that this proposal for a directive contains valid points, but, as other Members have said, I think that the price we are paying is too high. I have listened to everyone, but I think that, more than anything, this House should be able to strike a balance between the interests of patients, governments and the pharmaceutical industry. I have to tell Mrs Grossetête that the difference between us and the United States is that we boast a sound social security system that should also balance its books. Those of you in this House who argue in favour of six months protection are also those who very often caution in their own countries that the social security budget must be kept under control, and that cuts must be made. In order to keep this budget in balance, everyone must contribute, including the pharmaceutical industry. In our view, the six-month extension will lead to an unnecessary additional cost. That is why I will continue to support the amendments tabled by Mrs Corbey.
