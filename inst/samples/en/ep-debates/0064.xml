    Mr President, this part-session includes discussion of a directive stating that air controllers will have to speak and understand English to a satisfactory level in all Member States. English is already the language of air control. One of the entry requirements to train at Eurocontrol is a good knowledge of English, the international language of aviation. These proposals lessen the requirement to speak English across air traffic control. Amendment 17 says: ‘Member States may require level 5 of the ICAO proficiency test in English and/or the local language’. ‘Or’ means ‘or’ in any language. That threatens safety. The report contains phrases such as: ‘the right of Member States to develop national endorsements should only apply in exceptional cases’. That is not English, it is EU gobbledegook. World airlines fear the EU’s costly desire to switch air control from radar to Galileo, but the EU’s air control agenda is not really about airways, it is about EU control and control for the sake of it.
