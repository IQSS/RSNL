    Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. He has consulted painstakingly and taken due note of the views expressed by all the main players. In addition, I commend the productive efforts and efficient methodology employed in bringing about full and genuine cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs for all the main political groups. This has led to the achievement of a compromise package of amendments, which appears to have been widely accepted by most parliamentary groups, the Council and the Commission. Concerning the substance of the directive, with the compromise amendments, this will to a very large degree achieve the intended aims, i.e., to effect, as soon as practicably possible, a reduction in the emission of carcinogenic tyre debris into the environment to an acceptable level, by restricting the marketing and use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-rich extender oils and tyres. That would be done by harmonising the rules on the marketing and use of extender oils and tyres containing these toxic substances, thus preserving and improving the conditions and functioning of the internal market, while making sure that a high degree of health and environmental protection is achieved. Lastly, it should be mentioned that there have, sadly, been a few direct and indirect attempts by some transatlantic tyre manufacturers to manipulate the derailing of the effectiveness clause of this directive. It is to the credit of the rapporteur and the shadows that fortunately logic and a sense of preservation of the EU’s high standards of safety and efficiency prevailed and such attempts fortunately failed. That is a good example, demonstrating clearly that unity and common sense will always protect us against the ‘big brother’ approach sometimes propagated by a small number of US industrialists and politicians. In conclusion, I strongly urge you to vote in favour of the compromise amendment package presented to you in connection with Mr Adamou’s report.
