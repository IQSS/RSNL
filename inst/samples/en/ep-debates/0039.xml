    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me also begin my speech by thanking Mr Grosch once again, in particular for the well-balanced nature of his proposals with regard to the prescribed amount of regulation, because this provided a platform from which we were able to reach a very broad consensus on many points. I find it hard, on the other hand, to understand the attitude of the conservatives or that of Mr Jarzembowski, who wants to burden the changeover to a European driving licence with a transition period of seventy years. I ask you! If we were talking about a rule concerning the single market, a transition period in excess of ten years would not be contemplated for a single minute. In this matter we are seeing far too many signs of movement towards a rather cheap form of populism. There is, however, another point I should like to add. We should bear in mind that basic and advanced training will have to be a central and important objective. (The President cut off the speaker)
