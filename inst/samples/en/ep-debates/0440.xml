  <TEXT>
    – (The speaker spoke Irish) Mr President, I should like to welcome the proposal from the Commission. Financial aid in the field of trans-European transport and energy networks is important for maximising the benefits of cross-border cooperation in particular, and infrastructural integration. The European Community can contribute to this process by encouraging cooperation, promoting models of best practice and providing financial assistance. That will have practical benefits for my constituency in terms of networks across the island of Ireland and beyond, as I am sure will be the case for many other constituencies. I personally have concerns, however, when such instruments are used for the further privatisation of public services. That is something that I could not support.
