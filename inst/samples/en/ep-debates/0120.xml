    Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed directive being debated imposes an obligation in law upon independent legal professionals to record, register and declare confidential information provided by clients receiving legal advice to the financial services in the Member States. As a practising barrister, I can state without any hesitation whatsoever that this would have a major impact on the independence of the legal professions, and that it would violate the code of confidentiality that is one of the fundamental principles of these professions. A barrister who is required to work for a third party from the moment he comes into contact with a client would turn into a key witness, or in other words his own client’s worst enemy. To sum up, the scope of the proposed directive is such that it represents an unacceptable intrusion into the activities of independent legal professionals. Derogations from anti – money – laundering measures must be granted for activities covered by professional confidentiality, in order to safeguard the proper administration of justice and the existence of a meaningful defence, rather than a sham one.
