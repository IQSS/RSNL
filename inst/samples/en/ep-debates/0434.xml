  <TEXT>
    Mr President, I should like to point out that when planning for new routes, new destinations and new means of transport we should also look to the future. I refer to the matter of which future routes and means of transport we need to plan for, and the costs we will incur as a result. I should like to point out that there are many TEN routes in Europe whose full potential is not recognised. In my opinion, this includes the shortest transport link between Scandinavia and southern Europe, which runs from Sweden through my own country, Poland, via Szczecin, Wroclaw, Bratislava and Vienna. There is a lot of potential for developing new transport in Europe, and we should start thinking now about our future areas of investment.
