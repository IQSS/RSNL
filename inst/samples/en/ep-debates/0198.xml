    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the province of Upper Austria, from which I come, must surely be the world’s market leader in energy efficiency, and we have always concentrated on making that energy efficiency as economic as possible, in other words making it meet the Lisbon criteria. We all know that the cost of saving is now lower than the cost of new production. It follows that taking action to save energy also promotes growth and employment. In principle, however, we are against mandatory or binding targets. We should concentrate more on incentives and we should in particular see to it that account is also taken of Member States’ inputs, in my province, for example, that now has far fewer opportunities at the margins than others. We should also establish precisely who could achieve what savings with a benchmark system. Most important of all, we need a system of tried and tested practice. We need to learn, not only in Europe but across the world. Worldwide learning is crucial here. That is why I would like to recommend to Commissioner Piebalgs the establishment of a prize for energy efficiency for which the whole world can compete, so that we can become acquainted with the best models from all over the world and put them into use as quickly and efficiently as possible; that way, we in Europe, too, will be able to create new jobs and growth in this new sector. Perhaps we could also have an impact analysis of this sector so we can learn which measures have the most efficient and quickest effect. We should also look back over the past 10 years and compare the different Member States, also making comparisons on a world scale; that will give us a basis for the next 10 years for negotiating the targets we want to set and above all for deciding whether there is a place for incentives such as the ‘Intelligent Energy’ Programme, for example.
