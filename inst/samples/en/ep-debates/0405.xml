    Benjamin Disraeli said that almost everything great is created in youth. This is hyperbole, but there will never be too much attention paid to the young, the Europe of tomorrow. The youth programme for 2007-2013 is a step forward when compared with the current programme. We welcome the fact that the programme is more specific in its inclusion of the EU's new neighbours: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and the North Caucasus. This will allow young people to become acquainted with European values and initiatives as well as enter into relations with partners from EU states. It is very good that the programme will not only include young people aged 15-25, but will be open to those aged 13-30. The simplified rules for the submission of projects means that we will see more initiatives and far more young people will take advantage of the fruits of the programme. However, this also demands greater funding. Lithuania's youth are taking an active part in the work of the current programme. It is hoped that the implementation of the new programme will further foster reciprocal knowledge, understanding and tolerance and will reduce social isolation. Thank you.
