    Mr President, I should like briefly to correct an omission. I did not thank the rapporteur. She did an excellent job and I second the congratulations expressed by the honourable Members. It is true that this is a technical subject, but it touches upon many sensitivities. Mrs Drcar Murko did an excellent job in dealing with this issue and reaching the compromise that we have before us today. I am optimistic that we will have an agreement at first reading.
