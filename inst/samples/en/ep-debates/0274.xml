    (FR) Mr President, if you will allow me to briefly react, could I ask you, Commissioner, which side you are on? Did we not all agree to reduce the sum of EUR 21 billion to EUR 9 billion, which really is the minimum? You say, however, that nothing has been agreed in the financial perspectives, while Mr Böge stated that Natura 2000 cost EUR 21 billion. We need to have the guarantee that this EUR 21 billion will indeed be shared out across the budget. We believe that agriculture can take a third and that the Structural Funds can take another third. It is therefore for the environment to take its third.
