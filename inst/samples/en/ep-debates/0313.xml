    Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs De Sarnez for her report and for the work she has done. It is certainly not easy, when it comes to problems directly related to our society, that represent the very essence of our society, to unite the whole of Parliament, with the various visions, ideologies and cultures represented in it, around a single text. It is marvellous that Mrs De Sarnez has managed to achieve consensus in Parliament first of all, not to mention between the institutions, on the objectives presented by the Commission. As you will appreciate when I explain the Commission's position on this report, the majority of the amendments are acceptable to us fully or in principle. Before I discuss the details, however, I should like to hear Members' views on this report. Basically, I can say the following: the spirit of better regulation is fundamental to what we have to do. That is why we must strive to be as succinct as possible in legal texts and let the stakeholders, as well as the Member States, deal with the details of their implementation. As a Commissioner, I have tried to ensure that every level of our society takes its responsibilities seriously. That also includes, for instance, our media industries. A number of Parliament's amendments are not acceptable to the Commission in their current form, because they are too detailed or too prescriptive, or because of their substance. However, this debate might change my mind, so I am looking forward to hearing Members' input into this very important social issue. Our work is essential. We are not politicians for the sake of it; we make policies in order for our societies to be better off. When I speak about our societies, I mean the diverse cultures of the 25 Member States, which have to be brought together in one high-level European policy. I know Parliament is capable of that. That is why I shall listen to how Parliament wants the Commission to present its basic proposal to the Council. I have great confidence in what Parliament, in its wisdom, is going to say. Afterwards I shall try to draw the appropriate conclusions from the proposals that have been made. I shall listen with great interest when Mrs De Sarnez sets out Parliament's position.
