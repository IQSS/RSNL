    Mr President, Mr Nassauer’s report enables us to extend the fight against money laundering to terrorist financing by complying with the new international requirements. Our work with the rapporteur was very constructive, for which I thank him quite particularly. Parliament’s positions have been heard by the Council, which has made it possible to reach a compromise, particularly with regard to three essential points that we support. For the legal professions, we did not want to go back on the experience of the previous directive. That enables us to retain a balance between the obligations regarding verification and identification requirements and the preservation of the right to a fair hearing and of individual freedom. We very much regret, nevertheless, that the threshold for cash payments was not reduced to EUR 10 000 and that the threshold for percentage share holdings remains at 10%. Similarly, we think it would have been preferable for casino customers to be identified and their identity verified for a sum of EUR 1 000. One problem remains, namely that of tax and banking havens, some of which are still active on European territory. In this respect, we find it regrettable that the amendment put forward in committee by Mr Costa and Mr Peillon was not retained. I would like to add that the issue of judicial and police cooperation remains central and decisive in the context of the fight against money laundering, even though it is not covered by this directive. Currently, the Member States still create too many obstacles for this cooperation to operate satisfactorily and to be effective. We find this regrettable.
