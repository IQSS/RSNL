    Mr President, I am having difficulties in that regard, although I have had discussions with people in the insurance industry. On my recent trip to the United States I raised the issue with some of the insurance commissioners. As the honourable Member will well know, one – though not the only –difficulty with this issue is that in the United States each state has responsibility for that particular area. At least in the Member States of the European Union you can go to one regulatory supervisor in the Member State, you can go to the European Union for this particular directive; but in the United States each state has responsibility in this area and each state appoints its own insurance commissioners. It was believed that great strides had been made in recent years and the insurance industry on this side of the Atlantic had been working very hard and thought they had reached an understanding of how things would move forward. But then it all broke down, because the insurance commissioners change on a pretty regular basis in the United States. So one can appreciate the difficulties. During my recent trip to the United States in April, I raised this matter and now the talks are ongoing again. But I would like to underline the difficulties, which are mostly related to the issue to which I have just referred.
