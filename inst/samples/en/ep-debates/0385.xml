    Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a time of important and fundamental changes at both European and global level, it is only natural for the Committee on Culture and Education and the European Parliament to also evince a great deal of interest in an integrated programme of action in the field of lifelong learning. The Lisbon Strategy reiterates the objectives of education adapted to new technologies, to multilingualism, to diversity and to reinforcing programmes. Within this framework, particular importance is also attached to the mobility of students, school exchanges and the cross-border mobility of teachers. Encouraging the teaching and learning of two foreign languages and increasing grants for participants with disabilities and the learning and use of sign language are fundamental proposals by the rapporteur, Doris Pack. However, over and above all this, I should also like to highlight the obligation of the European Parliament to support particular aspects of specific amendments, especially in the field of the budget for special programmes, so that, in this way, we can demonstrate our awareness of the need to defend the history of cultures with the need for knowledge and the education of citizens. Furthermore, we must not forget that nowadays the demands for highly trained manpower are a necessary precondition to the strengthening of competitiveness. Adapting the education policies of the Member States to the prospects of lifelong learning reiterates and confirms that education is the cornerstone of the Lisbon Strategy and also contributes to social and economic development.
