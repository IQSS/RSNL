    I would like to thank those present for being here on what is perhaps the first night of summer, but I must admit that I am one of the victims of this summer night because of my hay fever, so I would like to ask for your patience. (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take advantage of the opportunity which I have to speak to Parliament in Greek, because this is an opportunity which, unfortunately, I do not have in the Commission, and to comment briefly, of course, on today's subject. When I appeared before you during my hearing, I assured you that I would promote health issues and, above all, consumer safety. The subject of debate now, and the next subject, are achieving precisely this objective: they combine the promotion of health and, of course, consumer protection. This is a proposal which makes a very significant contribution to health, but also takes account of the needs of industry for a clear, clarified, common European regulatory framework, which still allows for innovation and competitiveness and strengthens the internal market, while at the same time providing consumer protection. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Stubb. Of course, in an ideal world, consumers would get all the necessary nourishment from a healthy, standard diet. They would get all their nutrients through their normal diet. Unfortunately, however, this is no longer the case. Under today's conditions, with today's way of life, consumers need an additional boost to their diet, which is why it is useful to add both vitamins and inorganic salts – what we call minerals – to food. Consumers themselves want this, because the addition of these ingredients to food helps consumers to get satisfactory levels of these nutrients and to reduce the risks inherent in their deficiency as a result of insufficient consumption. This particular proposal fully harmonises rules for the voluntary addition of nutrients, but does not affect provisions at national level – usually for public health reasons – or at Community level on the compulsory addition of nutrients. The usual nutrients added are vitamins and minerals, which is why it is useful that the proposal specifically regulates these ingredients. However, use has increased over recent years not just of vitamins and minerals, but also of substances and ingredients which are used in an innovative way. That is why it is right that the proposal covers the safe use of these substances and, where considered necessary, brings them under the regulatory regime.
