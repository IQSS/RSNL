  <TEXT>
    Before I call on Commissioner Wallström to speak, I shall remind Members who have intended to make use of unofficial Union languages that this institution has a profound respect for their decision but, at the same time, according to a Bureau decision of 27 October last, speeches made in these languages cannot be translated and, consequently, cannot be Minuted. Members are therefore free to choose whether to make use of the Union’s minority languages. At the same time let us remember that in the Constitution we have written uniti in diversitate , ‘united in diversity’.
