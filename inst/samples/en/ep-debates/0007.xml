    The revised packaging and packaging waste directive marks another important step towards strategies and policies that focus on waste minimisation, recovery, reuse and recycling. In both the North and South of Ireland, similar directives are having a positive impact and changing both government practice and public mindsets with respect to domestic and commercial waste management. Much work remains to be done, but we now have many good examples to learn from, including innovative ideas on reuse. I also wish to stress the importance of deadlines for ensuring that Member States reach the targets agreed by the EU, and this includes deadlines for the newest Member States. At local government level in Ireland we have directives which show that recycling brings with it the notion of local authorities, from Belfast to Dublin, actively pursuing new forms of waste management, while at the same time government departments have been moved to concentrate their efforts as a result of these directives. It is important, however, that those countries which joined the European Union in June 2004 are treated fairly. I therefore support Mrs Corbey and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with respect to the amendments on this point. This is not about delay: it is about clarity, effectiveness and fairness. We need deadlines, but we also need clarity and fairness for all. On that basis the original agreement on dates should stand. It is also extremely important for us to ensure that countries can pursue policies on reuse and that we do not close down any possibilities in this respect. (The speaker spoke in Irish)
