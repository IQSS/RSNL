    Mr President, a child is not a small adult. A pill for a child is not half of that for an adult, and a child’s coat is not a shrunken version of an adult’s. In many areas of society children receive the attention they are due, but I am seriously amazed that there are not yet enough medicines available tested and intended specifically for children. Many diseases and illnesses have their own paediatric form, which have also to be treated employing a paediatric approach. However, fewer than 30% of the medications registered in Finland, for example, include dosage instructions for children of all ages. I will be happy to pay the price of complying with a six-month term, so that my grandchildren can receive better medications and treatment for their illnesses than they do now.
