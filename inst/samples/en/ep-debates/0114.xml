    Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Nassauer and everyone else involved in what we hope will be a first reading agreement. I was responsible for drafting the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee, which concentrated on two aspects: the position of lawyers and the process regarding, in particular, the review under the second directive. When I say the position of lawyers, I mean not just lawyers but also their clients and their clientsâ€™ access to justice. All of us know that Parliament has received a number of petitions from bar organisations around Europe. There have been legal challenges in Member States and, indeed, similar legislation had to be repealed in Canada because of a constitutional challenge. There are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers. It is with some sadness that we note that not all the amendments tabled by the Legal Affairs Committee in this regard were adopted. Having said that, we are happy to accept the compromises. However, with regard to the review, I asked the Commissioner in a written question if the review could still go ahead. He assured me that it would be completed by 2006. I would ask him to reiterate that assurance tonight and, if possible, tomorrow morning before we vote, so that lawyers at least know their position will be subject to review.
