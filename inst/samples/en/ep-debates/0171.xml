    I welcome the report by Mrs Scheele concerning the addition of vitamins, minerals, and certain other substances to foods. Differences among countries in legislative provisions governing this issue create barriers to the free movement of goods. Moreover, regulation at the European level would ensure that the same standards be applied in all Member States. The addition of vitamins, minerals, and additives to foodstuffs is often abused. Food producers use them to increase the attractiveness of their products by claiming that they contain more vitamins than other products, which is often not true. This creates the danger that consumers may increase their consumption of certain foods in the false belief that they are healthier and safer than other foods. We are often exposed to misleading advertisements claiming that the addition of a vitamin or another substance to a food product protects consumers from cancer or other diseases of ‘civilisation’. Foodstuffs that have a high content of calories, fats, or sugar do not, however, become healthier solely because they contain added vitamins or other substances. To ensure legal certainty and transparency, a positive list of substances whose addition to foods is permitted should be drawn up in order to avoid the enrichment of foods with substances that may be dangerous. At the same time, recommended minimum and maximum daily doses should be specified for certain substances. I therefore support the introduction of nutrition profiles. I believe it is the best way to secure the uniform control of food safety for different groups of consumers, be they children, pregnant women, or the elderly.
