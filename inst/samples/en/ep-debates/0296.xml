    One of the most controversial aspects of this proposal to set up the new Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity – PROGRESS – is that equality between men and women has been lumped into one single social programme, when the issue is not merely a social one. Accordingly, in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we have sought to strike a balance between the need to raise the profile of the struggle for genuine equality between men and women and the Commission’s proposal, bringing action on the ground and the existing directives closer together. Against this backdrop, the creation of the European Gender Institute is of major importance; it should be granted greater powers and its own financial resources, more so than the Commission is currently proposing. Most of the proposals that we adopted in the Committee on Women’s Rights have been addressed, at least in part, in the report by Mrs Jöns, whom I congratulate on her work. I should like to highlight the following points: the increase in cofinancing to a 90% ceiling, in light of the difficulties experienced by NGOs and other social organisations working in these areas; the increase in the financial framework to EUR 854.2 million for the seven-year period from 2007; and the change in the financial allocation between the different strands. This programme must effectively address the question of the protection and social inclusion of immigrants, the disabled, the unemployed, children and young people, and the elderly, along with issues such as working conditions, the fight against discrimination, and the promotion of diversity. I wish to stress, however, that gender mainstreaming and the issue of equality between men and women must be incorporated into all strands and measures forming part of the PROGRESS Programme and all programmes using Community funds, in order to prevent women from being victims of repeated discrimination and to prevent any backsliding on the policy of equality between men and women across a broad spectrum of areas.
