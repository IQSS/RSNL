    Mr President, the regulation on the safety of medicinal products for paediatric use is a necessary and sensible alternative that puts an end to a long period of uncertainty surrounding medicinal products in the paediatric sector. The Commission’s proposal was well-balanced and was based on impact assessments. A six-month extension of patent protection as an incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers is reasonable. This period is based on the results of the impact study and is a clear, fair basis for calculation for all manufacturers. I am pleased that a majority in Parliament supports this fixed period. Variable patent protection is impracticable and entails a considerable administrative burden. In addition, the duration of a patent must never be dependent on a product’s sales figures. The international competitive situation of the research-oriented pharmaceutical industry demands that we take a look at Europe’s attractiveness as a research destination. This is another reason why I see no material arguments in favour of the reduction in the fixed six-month period that is still under discussion.
