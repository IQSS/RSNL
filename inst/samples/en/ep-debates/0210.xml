  <TEXT>
    Mr President, my many thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, for her excellent levels of cooperation with the political groups. The Council of Ministers wanted to impose too many restrictions on the publicâ€™s access to information. We support the rapporteur in her conclusion that we did not agree to this and that, accordingly, the compromise at first reading was not reached. It is reasonable to establish a database where existing environmental data can be made greater and more varied use of. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to emphasise that our citizens must have the right freely to access information that is relevant to their lives and health on, for example, environmental pollution, even if many polluters of the environment, for example, would not like it. Moreover, even if it is important for many authorities to collect revenue for the information it produces when it is being used for commercial purposes, it is important that our citizens can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own lives and health without having to pay for it.
