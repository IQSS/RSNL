    Mr President, honourable Members, I am sure you will appreciate it if I refrain from speaking northern Swedish – if there is such a thing. Firstly, Mrs Jackson, as you know, our proposal suggests a deadline of 31 December 2012 for all the new Member States. The amendment confirms the deadline for seven new Member States, but allows a deadline of 2013 for Malta, 2014 for Poland and 2015 for Latvia. In reply to your question, this reflects the wishes the new Member States expressed to the Commission in the consultation round in spring 2003. A recital in the revised directive states that the deadline to be agreed should not be later than those dates. It is also my understanding that no agreement was reached in conciliation on a particular date. The recital indicated specifically that the decision should be taken on the basis of requests from the acceding states for derogations, which would not in principle extend beyond the dates mentioned. So there is nothing to suggest that the date could not be earlier. The Commission considers that this matter should be debated openly, treating all countries equally. We have no problem in accepting differentiated dates, if that is what Parliament and the Council want. On the costs, we do not anticipate any significant change. There will be no dramatic change in costs if the dates are changed. Thank you for this important debate and your valuable cooperation on environmental issues. I hope we will meet again soon.
