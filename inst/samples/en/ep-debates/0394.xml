  <TEXT>
    The development towards a knowledge-based society makes high demands on the educational level of the labour force. Given the current economic climate, emergence of new economic competitors, investing in people becomes even more important. Lifelong learning has therefore a key role in developing an integrated strategy for employment and particularly for promoting a well-trained workforce which is able to adapt to the continuously changing market environment. If managed pragmatically, the integrated approach will result in economic growth, greater civic participation, higher welfare. The action programme has in itself more chances then pure economic benefits: it has also potential to fulfil the goals and ambitions of Member States to create tolerant and democratic societies, reduce inequalities and prevent marginalization, to participate in building a gender-balanced, better society. The comprehensive, and integrated programme of lifelong learning is vital for achieving the Lisbon objectives. The coherence and synergy makes it even more efficient. The success lies in ensuring the accessibility to the opportunities for all European citizen at all levels.
