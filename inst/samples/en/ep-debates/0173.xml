    I wish to inform the House that the rise in the use of harmful chemicals in agriculture and food processing has been the subject of growing criticism in Poland, as well as in many of the other new Member States. CAP mechanisms have necessitated their use and family – run farms, which could have moved over to certified organic food production, have been the ones to suffer from this common agricultural policy. Numerous studies have shown that, in comparison to food produced by industrial agriculture, organic food has higher levels of easily – absorbed vitamins, minerals and other health – promoting substances. Our aim should therefore be to reduce the demand for artificial additives, which has been created by advertising and pseudo – scientific lobbying, at the same time as ensuring that consumers have access to a wide range of genuinely safe and high – quality organic food. I believe that it would be appropriate at this point to highlight the achievements and work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and of this House as a whole. A balance has been achieved in the new regulation between health – related arguments and business arguments. At the same time, the fraudulent practices of the food industry, which conquers markets in order to sell products that are harmful to health, will be curbed.
