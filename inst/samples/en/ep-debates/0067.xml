    Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first to congratulate Mr Schmitt on the extremely full and balanced nature of his work. At last we have a text of very great quality, and the work of amendment done in committee makes an important parliamentary contribution. It is a text that flows naturally from the work we did during the last parliamentary term, that is to say on the establishment of the single European sky, and this social dimension was absolutely essential because we are dealing with a public safety service that is first of all a manpower service. The quality of air traffic control and of air navigation depends on the men and their qualifications, and its quality is of course its high level of safety. I believe the text meets all these requirements. I do not know what the outcome of the vote will be tomorrow, but it seems to me that it represents rather the anti-Bolkestein approach. It is an exercise in Community regulation. It is an exercise in harmonised regulation. It is an exercise in mutual recognition, with extremely detailed work on certification, endorsements and mutual recognition. From that point of view, I am very pleased with it. From this perspective, Amendment 20, which wants it made clear that air traffic controllers will be subject to the social jurisdiction of the country where they work, is quite crucial. It will be the explicit confirmation of what we all want, that is to say harmonisation, not social dumping. Secondly, we are again presenting Amendment 22 on the sectoral social dialogue. I know that some of our fellow Members say that goes without saying. However, we think it is even better to say it, especially since the Single Sky Committee has not agreed to include workersâ€™ representatives, which is quite crucial for the quality of the service in this field.
