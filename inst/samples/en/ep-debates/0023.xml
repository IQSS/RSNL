    Mr President, I should first like to say thank you to Mrs Mastenbroek, who has achieved the feat of having her first report adopted, all being well, at first reading. She deserves to succeed because this project – our joint project and not that of some people who oppose some other people, a project that must involve the whole of society – is intended to provide real support to the benefits that new technologies can bring us, without the negative influences about which the Members of this House have spoken so eloquently. Naturally we shall do everything in the new programme to improve security for parents, and of course the security that they wish for their children. We shall also do everything – and Mr Paasilinna is right in this regard – to bring in a tough policy. After all, we cannot pursue such a policy solely with a softly-softly approach, by taking the soft law route. We should, instead, be basing new policy on the third pillar, which offers the possibility of policies that are tougher but more difficult to put in place. Nonetheless, Mr President, I feel it is crucial that general awareness is raised of a known problem. We must also be clear – and Members of this House have expressed this very well – that if we do not grab this problem by the scruff of the neck, that if we are not able to resolve the problem, then what could be and will be an important technology for Lisbon will not be moving harmoniously in the right direction. We therefore have a responsibility towards our society and the weaker elements thereof to be proactive. In this regard, I thank Parliament and its Members for helping the Commission and the Council to accomplish their task.
