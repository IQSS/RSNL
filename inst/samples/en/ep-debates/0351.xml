    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about the need for a regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use. I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, for her deeply committed speech, and also for her fair discussion of the matter. Of course, by the end of the debate it is difficult to introduce new points of view, so I should just like to make my point symbolically. 120 seconds’ speaking time in this House is very little in view of the significance of this milestone in European pharmaceutical legislation; but a great deal – as I know from many years’ personal experience as a chief emergency physician – when it comes to saving children’s lives. We can also see this 120 seconds as a symbol that it is time for Europe to at last roll out an appropriate regulation for paediatric medicinal products. I should very much like to see a consensus at first reading, so that our European community can be restored to a respectable competitive position on the important international market in pharmaceutical research and manufacture. I support the proposal for a uniform extension of patent protection. Mrs Grossetête, and now Commissioner Verheugen as well, have convinced me that this is the right, simple, and practicable way to go. We have included a revision clause entitling us to make improvements for the eventuality that the profits are as exorbitant as we suspect they will be. We have to take great care when discussing this issue, as it concerns children – the most precious things we have – and human lives, on the one hand, and economic interests on the other. These two things cannot be weighed against each other.
