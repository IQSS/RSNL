    Mr President, groundwater is a priceless natural resource, not a national resource, and it should be treated as a resource without which humanity cannot survive. Consequently we have no right to compromise on the quality of water or to cut deals here on the quality of water. We must err on the side of precaution, not on the side of cost. I have no confidence at all that Member States will maintain or indeed establish adequate standards. They have failed to do so up to now. They have allowed thousands of illegal dumps right across Europe, including in Ireland. Ireland has not yet implemented the 1992 Nitrates Directive. Thirteen years later it still has not implemented that directive, not because it is not necessary – it is absolutely necessary in Ireland – but because it is afraid of the Irish Farmers Association. I want to conclude by saying that we must not only set stringent standards, we must set strict and severe penalties for those Member States which fail to meet those standards and we should not hide behind the principle of subsidiarity, which is simply escaping from our responsibilities.
