    Mr President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions. The adoption of Parliament’s opinion in line with the agreement reached with the Council will pave the way for the early adoption of this directive. This would not have been possible without a spirit of cooperation and compromise on all sides and the political will to make it happen. I would like to thank you warmly for this. The European Union is in the vanguard of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, adding to its credibility and weight in its bilateral relations with its main diplomatic partners as well as in the different international fora dealing with these matters. Mrs Wallis raised the issue of the treatment of lawyers. The Commission is favourable to the amendment to Article 39, which foresees that within two years of the expiry of the deadline for transposition of the directive the Commission will draw up a report on its implementation, which will include the specific examination of the treatment of lawyers and other professions. But, in any case, I reiterate my firm intention, as also expressed in replies to parliamentary questions, to carry out by mid – 2006 an examination of the treatment of lawyers and other legal professions, amongst others, as foreseen in the second directive, which is still applicable. Let me once again thank Mr Nassauer, Mr Muscat and all the others who have contributed to this positive outcome. The Commission fully endorses the agreement and accepts all amendments that form part of the compromise package agreed with the Council.
