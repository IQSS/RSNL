    Mr President, I should just like to make an observation about the law of unintended consequences. A lot of the legislation that we adopt in this place does not actually work in the way that it should. A recent example in the United Kingdom involved a female pilot, Mrs Starmer, who has one child and, I think, has another on the way. She took British Airways to an industrial tribunal because it did not allow her to have part – time flying responsibility. British Airways suggested that she did not have enough hours or experience to take on that role. I think – and I have never heard anybody suggest otherwise – that British airmanship is the best in the world, even the Americans concede that. British Airways, as I think you will agree, is a benchmark across the globe for high standards of airmanship. Mrs Starmer won at a tribunal on the basis of legislation, and nobody knows when they get on a plane whether the pilot is actually competent to fly that aeroplane, or somebody who is a young mum just having fun. I think that is a great shame.
