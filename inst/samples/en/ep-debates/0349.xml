    Mr President, it has been a shameful stigma on our 21st century civilisation that, to this day, many of the medicines we use to treat our children are untested for paediatric use and that a large number of medicines that could be of lifesaving benefit to children are not used because they never underwent paediatric testing. In a world in which it seems, perhaps, inevitable that economic profit is, to a great extent, the cornerstone of our existence, the Commission has finally brought before us a remedial proposal based mainly on financial terms and mores. The pharmaceutical companies will now have to measure a child's ill-health on financial balance sheets and proceed with paediatric drug development only if it is profitable. I do not necessarily blame them: they produce medicines to make money and if they do not make money they will not be able to produce medicines. This is unfortunately the harsh reality and those of us with more romantic aspirational fantasies will just have to accept it. This piece of legislation, despite its ideological shortcomings, will help develop more and safer drugs for children. It is therefore an important step forward and deserves our full support, although its application will have to be monitored closely, especially with regard to the proper ethical scrutiny of paediatric clinical trials.
