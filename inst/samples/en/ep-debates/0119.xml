    Mr President, I find it hard to believe that nobody questions the need for this legislation. As Mr Nassauer says, we do not actually have any evidence that the existing legislation works, so making it tighter is hardly justifiable at this time. The European Union is going out of its way, as usual, to make life difficult for ordinary businesses and citizens, and hindering business activity. Much more sinister, in my opinion, is the obligation on professional advisers not to inform their clients when they report suspicious transactions to the authorities. Turning professionals into secret informers erodes trust within society and marks the beginning of a police state. A better way to address terrorism is to know who is entering and leaving our countries. Alas, with the ongoing disagreements about how to police our borders and the drive for indefinite expansion of the Union, the prospect of reliable border controls is becoming ever more remote.
