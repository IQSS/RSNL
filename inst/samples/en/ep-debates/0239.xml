    Mr President, at this point, it is well worth remembering why the Commission put forward this proposal back in 2003. In the long, hot summer of that year, the electricity systems in Europe could not cope, and a blackout in Italy and some problems elsewhere meant the Commission deemed this proposal necessary. This proposal should give transmission system operators the tools to balance supply and demand in a much better way. The elements of the proposal concentrate on cementing good regulatory practice, to open the electricity market and to encourage investments in infrastructure in a more competitive market. Furthermore, the proposal clearly requires the necessary steps to be taken to meet the needs of the electricity industry. I wish to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their commitment to security of supply and infrastructure. In his report, Mr Chichester has introduced many important and positive amendments to the Commission’s original proposal. The Parliament has contributed a great deal to the improvement of the text. The compromise amendments set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders regarding the delivery of secure electricity supplies and the upkeep of the networks. The Commission is therefore in a position to accept most of the amendments. However, the importance of cross-border interconnector projects has not been reflected sufficiently in the amendments made by Parliament. There is a clear regulatory gap in this area and the directive as drafted by Parliament does not fill this gap adequately. At this stage, the Commission takes note of the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council while regretting the change concerning Article 7. The Commission maintains its position as to the need to strengthen the regulator’s role with regard to infrastructure investment. Consequently, the Commission maintains reservations about Compromise Amendment 23.
