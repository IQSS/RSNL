    Madam President, I too congratulate the rapporteur after her travails and the dedication she has shown to this task, from which she has emerged with more success than her predecessor in the last Parliament. She said that we ought to talk to the consumer groups in Europe and see what they think. Well, many of us have done so. I have a letter here, on behalf of 28 consumer groups in all of the Member States, and what do they say? They ask us to vote for Article 4 and for a sensible version of Article 11. I heard what Mrs Niebler said earlier on in the debate and I was astonished by it. What in God’s name has all this to do with the Lisbon Process? I do not know about God – he has been around for a long time so he obviously has a healthy diet – but I know what I think and that is that the Lisbon Process, among other things, requires us to have well – informed consumers who make real choices which increase the marketability of the products they buy. Everybody benefits from that, it is a benign circle, and to have it denounced as though it is simply an instrument of the nanny state and so on, as we have heard in the course of this debate, is absolute rubbish. I personally hope that we vote to retain Article 4. We need to have some way of dealing with the misleading claims which are made, which balance one substance against another, and only tell you about the one for which the claim could be made. The only way to do that is to have some effective template from which this can be made. The Commission has worked long and hard on this. I have many representatives of the food industry in my own constituency who have said that provided we just have that template within the Poli Bortone report, we do not then need it in Mrs Scheele’s proposals, we do not need it for fortification, but we should have it somewhere. And so we should. I cannot vote for this proposal tomorrow if the emasculation of Article 4 takes place.
