  <TEXT>
    It is a report about the Directive which for the first time speaks in a direct way about the concept of the financing of terrorism, as apart from money laundering. In fact we are speaking about two totally different processes. Money laundering â€¦ There is no interpretation! That is what we get when we are told that Maltese is an official language of the European Union! So there are no interpreters here; we have no interpreters in committee; we have no translations of documents; and now we are not even able to speak our language in plenary. I am not going to continue to deliver my speech, Mr President. No way. You should take the necessary action on this. What is the use of having it down on paper that Maltese is an official language? (Applause) I thank the Commission and the Council; I thank Mr Nassauer for his sterling work on the report, but either give us our language, or it is thank you and goodbye.
