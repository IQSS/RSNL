    Madam President, if the Germans have a problem with their driving licences, what is to stop the German Government from sorting it out? Equally, if we are talking about road safety, what is to stop the Portuguese and Italian Governments from improving road safety on their roads? We in the UK have some of the most crowded and some of the safest roads anywhere in western Europe. Yet we are now faced with the prospect of harmonising driving licences, and this report makes clear that harmonising penalties for driving offences cannot be far behind. When you look at the disgraceful treatment of legitimate tourists in Greece on a plane-spotting holiday, we now know just what pan-European Union justice can mean! That affected only a few unfortunate individuals, but almost everyone in Britain drives a car. If national courts are given powers to impose penalties on drivers' licences issued in other countries, the prospect of a Greek court banning, or attempting to ban, a British driver from driving in Britain will cause a row the like of which even you have not yet experienced from Britain!
