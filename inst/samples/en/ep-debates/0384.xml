    I welcome the Commission's efforts to integrate and simplify European educational programmes and would like to draw your attention to the amendments submitted by our rapporteur Doris Pack, which not only underline the necessity to ensure the continuity of life-long learning, but also the need for an increase in funding for European programmes, including Erasmus. This would, above all, take into account the number of participants in this programme, which has increased and continues to grow. In addition we cannot disagree with the proposal that the average grant be increased from 210 Euros to 300 Euros by 2007 at the end of the programme. Given the EU's changed national linguistic diversity, we cannot disagree with the proposal to create more flexible opportunities to study at least two languages. I also trust that you will take into account an amendment which I have submitted, stating that we would like the European Humanities University that was exiled from Belarus, but was reopened two weeks ago in Vilnius, to become a candidate for priority funding. The Union for Europe of the Nations approves Doris Pack's report.
