    Consumers generally have two main expectations with regard to this special commodity, electricity: that it should be cheap and that it should be available at the desired time and in the desired quality and quantity. The citizens of the Union likewise expect guaranteed security of supply, along with stable prices. Let us therefore ask the question: does this directive fulfil these expectations? Certainly in itself it does not. But there is a good chance that we are now taking a step in the right direction, bearing in mind considerations of competition and sustainability, and reconciling rules and objectives already negotiated and those to be negotiated in future. We certainly agree that reconciling these different perspectives is no easy task. But we also have to agree that there is a great need to ensure security of supply, reasonable prices and sustainability, because many European citizens have not yet been able to feel the benefits of market integration. We could no doubt mention many examples of this, but allow me to cite, as one such example, central-eastern Europe’s power generating units, which are not infrequently more than 40-50 years old, or the fact that, in purchasing power parity terms, a Hungarian citizen today pays twice or three times as much for electricity as the citizens of some of the older Member States. This directive is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to expand transmission network capacity, an opportunity to develop new, cross-border connections and an opportunity to renovate production capacities. We will have to seize this opportunity, however, to ensure that this new legislation does not mean increased administration, more and more complicated licensing procedures, in short, a greater burden, but that it means genuine help for the sector and ultimately for consumers. This is what the citizens of Europe expect of us, so we should not content ourselves with less.
