    Mr President, there is a whole debate on this issue. I am sure that on many issues both sides have the right arguments, as both the innovative and generic industries have an important role in the medicine sector. Whilst I understand the importance of innovation, as a Socialist and Hungarian MEP I think that the social aspect should take priority. For retired people and families with children in Hungary, medicine represents a large part of their living expenses. In the transition to capitalism, the cost of medicine became extremely high in Hungary compared to people's incomes. Further increases would be unacceptable for me. The rapporteur has to understand that the extra price of the extension period would be paid by the most vulnerable strata of society, the poor and their children. That is why I support the 'three plus three months' extension period. Hungarian Socialists support all the amendments by Mrs Corbey and Mrs McAvan, which many of us have signed.
