    Mr President, Commissioner, we should talk not about the PROGRESS programme, but about the PROGRESS programmes, which Europe hopes will develop as a result of your Commission's proposal. Efforts to rationalise the funding administered by your Commission are praiseworthy and we hope that they will prove to be successful in achieving greater cohesiveness and avoiding duplication when this new programme is adopted. Without ignoring the competence of the Member States, efforts are being made to safeguard the acquis communautaire and to apply the open method of coordination in the fields of employment, social protection, the organisation and improvement of working times, the fight against discrimination and gender equality. Reducing the number of budget lines from 28 to 2 and harmonising the scope of the four programmes which already exist will, we hope, help to make support for the social and political agenda of the Lisbon Strategy more effective. I congratulate the rapporteur because, with her ability to take a balanced view, she accepted all the positive improvements proposed by the committees in their opinions, especially by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for which I acted as shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I hope in particular that future provisions adopted by the programme committee, assisted by the four proposed subcommittees, will bring about the required simplification in the use and flexibility in the funding of the programmes, so that the participation of European networks and of national and regional non-governmental organisations becomes a reality, so that transnational cooperation is reinforced and mainstreaming to combat all forms of discrimination and gender discrimination and to reinforce participation by women and people with disabilities becomes a reality, so that the European Employment Strategy, which is the key to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, is helped by the social awareness which will strengthen the PROGRESS programmes. This programme is designed, therefore, to support the application of protection and of the fight against social exclusion, especially of minority groups, and improvements to the working environment, supplemented by the provision for combining family life and work so that women are given the opportunity to participate in the workplace. We are also hoping for measures to combat all forms of discrimination against immigrants and to integrate them by recognising undeclared work, as proposed by the programme. Thank you. We hope that the objectives of the programme will be implemented.
