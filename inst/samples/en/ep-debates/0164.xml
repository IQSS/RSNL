    Madam President, I am informed that the Court did not contest the existence of the positive list. It contested the procedure. Therefore, we will adjust accordingly on the procedure. Second, it is not an exclusive list, so that also avoids any problem. We therefore believe that this form of positive list will survive. While I have the floor I should mention something I forgot to point out to the honourable Member. For some time now we have been trying to arrange a date on which I can visit the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in order to introduce the health and consumer programme and answer other questions. Owing to various problems affecting the committee and myself, it has taken longer than I would have wished.
