    Mr President, I thank Parliament for this interesting and important debate. I am delighted that the opinion adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs shares with the Commission’s proposal the same desire to simplify and to rationalise, and I would like to say a few words about the Commission’s position with regard to certain major amendments. Having regard to Amendment 55 on the inclusion of regional and national non-governmental organisations as potential beneficiaries of the programme, the Commission stresses that this support for national and regional NGOs has not been ruled out. Nevertheless, the Commission wished to send a signal to clearly indicate that the programme is first and foremost aimed at NGOs organised at EU level, as they bring a higher degree of added value. As regards increasing the financial envelope of the programme,  Amendments 66 and 73  together with dividing the funds among the various sections of the programme and the flexibility reserve provided for  Amendments 67 and 74  the Commission is not opposed to a debate on these issues but, at this stage, it is not amending its initial proposal and is waiting for an overall agreement on the financial perspectives. Having regard to Amendment 59, which divides the Committee into five subcommittees corresponding to the five sections of the programme, the Commission will not change its position with regard to the fact that it wishes to be assisted by only one committee on the PROGRESS programme, even if the members of this committee may change according to the agenda, as is indicated in recital 12a of the amended proposal for a Council decision. I am pleased to note that the position of the European Parliament is not very far removed from that of the Commission. Inter alia, the amendments aimed at strengthening the role of the European Parliament or, furthermore, at mainstreaming the gender dimension are very much welcomed by the Commission. There is no danger that we will lose sight of gender mainstreaming in the new PROGRESS programme; on the contrary, the Commission will ensure that it highlights the aspect of gender which, by being integrated into the new programme, will strengthen the principle of mainstreaming. I quite understand the concerns expressed in the draft opinion of Parliament; that is why the Commission will amend its proposal as far as possible in order to respond to this opinion of Parliament. Mr President, I will now list the amendments that the Commission can accept in full: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 47, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 68, 69 and 70. The Commission can substantially accept the following Amendments, but accept only the spirit of parts of them, and on condition that they are reworded: 4, 11, 14, 18, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 35, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 58, 64, 65 and 71. Finally, the Commission must reject Amendments: 9, 16, 23, 33, 38, 50, 51, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 66, 67, 72, 73 and 74. In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the quality of its debate on this proposal. Thanks to the dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament, I can say with conviction that the resulting text will take better account of the political objectives of the European Parliament while at the same time having contributed to the effort to simplify and to rationalise, which will be to the advantage of the beneficiaries. The PROGRESS proposal submitted to you is essential for implementing the new social agenda. This programme will enable us to give financial backing to the instruments we have, such as the open method of coordination, the drafting of legislation and efforts to monitor its application, the exchange of good practices and the action of non-governmental organisations. Mr President, that is my conclusion.
