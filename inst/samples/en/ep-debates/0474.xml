  <TEXT>
    Mr President, I shall be very brief and respond to just a couple of issues. I have been very impressed with the contributions and the commitment and passion with which they have been expressed tonight. I wish to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac, the Members of the European Parliament and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their hard work and cooperation. Mr Jarzembowski asked whether the Council would now in turn accept the text. If Parliament proposes a consolidated text in its entirety, then the Presidency of the Council will bring it to the Ministers’ attention at the earliest possible opportunity and the Presidency will recommend it to the Council. Another issue mentioned was the European Aviation Safety Agency. The Council will, of course, consider the Commission’s proposals concerning that agency. This has been an impressive debate with many impressive contributions. The passion for this subject and the issue of safety and information for passengers have come over loud and clear this evening. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to that debate. (Applause)
