    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have learned that monopolies are inefficient. We have also learned that a deregulated market demands quality controls both on the variety of producers needed to guarantee the electricity supply and to meet demand and on the network itself and the network’s structure. We have also learned of the need to check that these investments in actual fact take place. In Sweden, we had a very long power failure after the big storm last winter. It became very clear then that none of these quality controls had been fully implemented. When this happens, not only does industrial production come to a halt, but other functions important to society are also affected and people’s quality of life is dramatically reduced. I should like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission on some excellent work which has been pioneering in terms of value for voters.
