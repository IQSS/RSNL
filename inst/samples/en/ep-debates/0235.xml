    Mr President, 20 years ago an eminent health pathologist warned that she had never examined a cancerous tumour that did not have chemicals from the benzene family in the active reproducing cancer cells. Cancer has become the new Black Plague. In the Middle Ages half the population of Europe was destroyed. They did not know the source of the bubonic menace and were unable to halt it in its deadly tracks. There is no excuse for us; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from. We make tyres with them, but we also create them when we burn waste. The Irish Government is insisting that a network of waste incinerators, some for toxic waste, be created in my country, thus introducing an explosion of PAHs into our water, air, soil, plants and into the cells of Irish citizens where the benzenes and dioxins can wreak havoc. Let us urgently concentrate on the substantial risk of PAHs from sources such as incinerators, especially when those incinerators will burn tyres containing PAHs.
