    Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties would also like to express its gratitude to the rapporteur who has been involved in the parliamentary works on this topic for years. Our committee believes that the right to education is one of the most important fundamental human rights, and no one should be prevented from exercising this right by financial status, poverty or discrimination; also, we must continue to demand equal treatment. Equal treatment for different generations, for the non-young, for women, and especially for single mothers, and in this respect we naturally expect an understanding attitude from employers, as well, who must treat life-long education as a strategic interest. We expect that ethnic discrimination will come to an end and those living with disabilities will be able to participate in the education process with full rights. For us this is a community programme that brings the EU closer to its citizens and the citizens closer to one another, which is the reason why we love this programme.
