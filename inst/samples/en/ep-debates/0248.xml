    Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chichester, ladies and gentlemen, we have a programme and can expect the Member States to produce precise regulations by 1 December 2007. The Commission could do a great deal to support them in this, notably by adopting regulations to create financial incentives, perhaps in the form of projects to support the establishment of best practice and benchmarking by that date. Even if that goal cannot be achieved in that time, it is certainly possible to create a stable environment for it by means of a further framework directive. I believe that the increasing demand that is to be expected means that we need, first and foremost, a stable investment environment. Energy efficiency needs to be promoted, and I would like particularly to congratulate the Commissioner on regarding that as the first priority. Another primary requirement is for distributed generation, which will make the network more stable, and this will require proper maintenance and the development of a true internal market.
