    Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and also thank her for this report. It was to the report’s credit that the committee voted unanimously in favour of the report. Its main reason for doing so was that the proposal gives us the continuity needed for promoting equality, and continuity is necessary if the measures are to have the effect, and indeed long – term effect, intended. Naturally, this is extremely significant because there is still such an incredible amount to do in the area of equality. It is sometimes stated that, at the rate at which the work on equality is going at present, we shall still have hundreds of years to go before we feel that we live in an equal society. In addition to continuity, to which attention is also drawn by the report, it is also necessary to integrate the equality perspective into all policy areas. I also want just to take this opportunity strongly to request that those organisations and projects that are to receive aid should be carefully evaluated and inspected so that the results are as constructive as possible.
