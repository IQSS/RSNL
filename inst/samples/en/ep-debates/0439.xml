    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing criteria for infrastructure projects for energy and transport, and we need to do so, too, as the story of promises of new infrastructures without accompanying measures is a story of frustrated hopes. That is why I attach particular importance to these framework conditions, which are necessary as, without them, there would be no point in even the most expensive of projects. I therefore attach particular importance to making cofinancing conditional on the realisation of the common signalling system, the performance of cost-benefit analyses, and compliance with and regard for EU environmental legislation. Here I am also thinking of the Messina Bridge: I find it hard to understand why this project should be given parity of treatment with cross-border projects. I should like to mention an idea for the future: why not, in future, induce countries in need of EU funding for new infrastructures to levy tolls for the management and maintenance of these infrastructures? Failure to do so will give rise to an imbalance and distortion of competition.
