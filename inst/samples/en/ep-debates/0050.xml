    Mr President, I strongly support the rapporteur's approach to this issue. In fact, I wonder why we cannot consider moving more quickly to the credit card-size licence. Considering we transferred from 15 different currencies to the single European currency in a matter of weeks, it seems to me that transferring from 110 different models of licence to a single licence must be a far easier process. One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular. It must be a disincentive for them, having also to pay for training and in many cases repeating their tests. This must result in a large number of young people around Europe driving without proper licensing and, therefore, presumably without proper insurance. I know that in Ireland, the Automobile Association estimated that a fifth of the drivers on our roads have provisional licences. These are licences issued on the basis of paying a fee and getting a licence over the counter. There is at least a 12-month waiting list to get a test, and if people then fail that test - as a high proportion do - they drive on the roads without adequate training and proper knowledge for a period of at least two years. Whilst it is a very good idea to have common standards across Europe, we must address the question of whether Member States are ensuring that the people who get these provisional licences in particular, are capable of driving safely. Road death statistics seem to prove that they do not.
