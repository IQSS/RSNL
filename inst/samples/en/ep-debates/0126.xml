    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is delighted that Parliament has been able to approve, without amendment, the proposal seeking to extend the two Community action programmes in the field of equality between men and women until the end of 2006. This is a significant contribution to the Community’s efforts to promote equality between men and women, and I should like to thank the House for its support. In view of the fact that the Council adopted the general guideline in December 2004, also without amendment, Parliament’s backing will make it possible to take decisions in the very near future, and probably before the end of the Luxembourg presidency. These decisions will greatly facilitate the planning and successful implementation of programmes over coming years. Ladies and gentlemen, although to all appearances this is a simple technical solution, its impact will nevertheless be great. I am therefore delighted that after considering the Commission’s proposal, the House has tabled it without any additional comments.
