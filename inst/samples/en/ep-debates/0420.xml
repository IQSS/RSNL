    It is symbolic that in the same week when the leaders of Europe's countries will debate the challenges of globalisation, the Parliament is discussing the EU cultural programme. It is symbolic because in the future culture industries will probably become the European Union's main competitive advantage. We will be unable to compete in terms of labour costs or cost effectiveness. Therefore, it is very important to promote creativity and more attention must be devoted to this in the cultural programme. I disagree with the European Commission's opinion that the more participants in the cultural programme, the more visible it is. This is a grandiose view, whereas we must look towards cultural originality. This originality is certainly not achieved through the number of operators, and this should not be increased. Another important aspect, which is relevant to the promotion of culture and creativity, is namely the multilateral exchange process. Of course, it is very important for us to preserve our cultural heritage, but the cultural programme must put a clear emphasis on the future and the creative generation of new ideas. Thank you.
