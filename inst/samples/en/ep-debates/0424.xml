    Mr President, Commissioner, earlier this year, various cultural organisations mounted, with support from Parliament and the Commission, the action ‘70 cents per citizen’. It was clear to all how important this was in telling us all the things we could do with 70 cents and how much we ended up being left with. I must now join the ranks of those who keep coming back to money, but it is a fact that we cannot implement the demanding cultural programme with the budget that is available to us. The cultural programme as set out in the report ranges from the preservation of the cultural heritage to contemporary cultural events; it makes reference to linguistic diversity and to minority languages, and I believe that this is where there is a need for realistic thinking, for the allocation of realistic sums of money and for priorities to be set or, in the budget, to allow realism to take a back seat to vision and to be realistic about implementing the programme. While I agree with the honourable Member who said that it was essential to defend our cultural heritage, I do think we are very attached to contemporary art and must therefore attempt to find common ground.
