    Madam President, as a fan of Liverpool football club I must say that I was happy to come over here after the first half, because AC Milan is currently 3 – 0 ahead in the Champions’ League final. Commissioner, I would like to raise three points for you. First, I welcome the Commission’s proposal. It strikes a good balance on two accounts: it pushes forward the internal market by making it easier for food manufacturers to trade across borders; and it enhances consumer protection and gives us more safety and confidence. My second point is perhaps a slight criticism of the Commission relating to the part of the proposal where the Commission says it should apply to matters that are as yet undefined. In my mind that would amount to giving a blank cheque. My argument would be that if you know the substances, tell us. If you do not know, come back. Perhaps that is something you could rectify at second reading, Commissioner. Finally, it is important to harmonise those vitamins and minerals that can and cannot be added and the quantities involved. At the same time, it is important that Member States be able to impose some restrictions, as long as they are based on scientific evidence that there is a real risk to public health. I think the proposal is sound, especially in the light of the European Parliament’s amendments.
