    Mr President, the construction of trans-European transport and energy networks is of enormous significance for the EU, and in particular for the 10 new Member States. Extending such networks will reinforce the cohesion of regions and countries, as well as boosting business cooperation and development and the consolidation of the single market. Current needs far exceed the financial resources available, particularly in the new Member States. One of the key challenges we face is therefore to ensure that these resources are spent sensibly. Whether we succeed in doing so will depend to a large extent on the rapid development of plans for extending the networks over the next 30 years. Timely decisions on planned network routes would reduce unnecessary costs incurred as a result of land acquisitions. Local authorities would be able to block investment activities that would interfere with such routes, and to make provision for future projects in their development plans. I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work on the report.
