<p>RSNL (pronounced "arsenal") is open source software platform for
the statistical analysis of unstructured textual data, written for the
R language for statistical computing.  While the base R language has
exceptional capabilities for data analysis, it currently has only
rudimentary capabilities for processing textual data. On the other
hand, standard packages for statistical natural language processing
have extensive support for data processing but only limited support
for statistical modeling and data analysis.  RSNL serves as a bridge
between these two worlds by providing the language fundamentals for R
to analyze text data and making it easy to call routines from other
languages for processing textual data from within R.  RSNL thus
provides a unified (and eventually comprehensive) suite of tools for
data processing, statistical analysis, and graphical displays of
textual data, and a platform on which it is easy to build new tools.
We hope this accelerates the development of new statistical methods
for textual data and more applied researchers who think of text
sources as just another data set.

<p>The initial version of RSNL will allow users to perform common
natural language processing tasks: Tokenization; Stemming; Token
filtering (by frequency, regular expression, arbitrary function);
Token replacing; Part of speech tagging; Calculate document and corpus
distance measures; Manage document relationships in a corpus (e.g.,
hyperlink network); Manage document structure (e.g., sentences and
paragraphs); HTML parsing; Readability tests (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid);
Functions to compute n-gram statistics.  In addition, RSNL seamlessly
integrates its own internal data structures with the standard data
types expected by existing R functions. The data structures used by
RSNL will be designed to accommodate the large datasets that are
common in statistical natural language processing work.

<p>RSNL will feature two sets of documentation---a developer API
designed for developers wishing to add functionality to the package
and a standard user manual designed to help applied researchers use
the package to solve substantive problems of interest to them.

<p>RSNL is currently in early development and the source distribution
available here is best described as pre-release code.

<ul> 

<li>RSNL depends on the R packages tm and Rstem, and rJava.</li>
    
<li>Currently, RSNL is available only as a source distribution.
    To install, sign on to R, and type:
    install.packages("RSNL",repos="http://gking.harvard.edu",
    type="source") or
<!-- rbuild: replace 'RSNL_' '.tar.gz' version -->
    <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/src/contrib/RSNL_0.11.tar.gz">download here</a> and install using R CMD INSTALL.</li>
<li>You can find a short introduction to RSNL's current capabilities
<a href="/RSNL/intro.pdf">here</a>.
</li>
